# Currency Converter

This is a simple web-based Currency Converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The project allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using live exchange rate data.

I created this project to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, API handling, and basic UI design.

## How It Works

- The dropdown menus are populated dynamically using a currency list
- Exchange rates are fetched from a public currency API
- When the user enters an amount and clicks **Get Exchange Rate**, the converted value is displayed
- The **Swap** button exchanges the selected currencies and updates the result instantly
- Country flags change automatically based on the selected currency
